# **Crime Prediction and Analysis Using MLP and XGBoost

# **Overview**  
This project implements a crime prediction and analysis system using **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** and **XGBoost** models. The system predicts crime types based on input features like **time, date, latitude, and longitude**, helping law enforcement in proactive crime prevention.  

#### **Features**  
- Predicts crime type based on spatial and temporal data.  
- Utilizes **MLP** for deep learning-based pattern recognition.  
- Employs **XGBoost** for high-performance classification.  
- Compares model performance for accuracy optimization.  

#### **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for MLP)  
- **XGBoost**  
- **Scikit-Learn**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data processing)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)  

#### **Dataset**  
The model is trained on a crime dataset containing records with features like **date, time, longitude, latitude, and crime category**. Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.  

#### **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crime-prediction-mlp-xgboost.git
   cd crime-prediction-mlp-xgboost
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the training script:  
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```  
4. Test the model:  
   ```bash
   python predict.py --time "12:30" --date "2025-02-14" --lat "37.77" --long "-122.42"
   ```  

#### **Model Performance**  
- **MLP Accuracy**: *~80.43%*  
- **XGBoost Accuracy**: *Higher efficiency with feature importance tuning*  

#### **Future Improvements**  
- Integration with real-time crime reporting systems.  
- Enhancing accuracy using additional contextual features.  
- Deploying the model as an API for public use.
